👋 Hi, I'm Annika (aka kub3anni)! 

Product Owner by day, world traveler by night (and weekends!). 
I've been working for @plusserver for 2 years now. I lead the charge on the plusserver Kubernetes Engine (PSKE) ⚙️, making cloud-native dreams come true.
When I'm not wrangling features, you'll find me on a plane 🛫, train 🚂, or van exploring the world.
Always up for nerding out on new tech (even though I'm more product than devops 😉). Let's connect!
